# Hello , this project is a small portfolio !

For this project i use astro to test the framework.

I only made to page on this project the index page to display my skill and one 404 page to redirect people and make a little animation

I take the design inspiration and color scheme for the project of [portfolio](https://robiot.dev/) made by Robiot
