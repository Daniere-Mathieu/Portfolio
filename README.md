# Hello, this project is a small portfolio!

For this project, I used Astro to learn the framework.

I only made two pages for this project: the index page to display my skills and one 404 page to redirect people and include a little animation.

I took design inspiration and color scheme for the project of a portfolio made by Robiot.

If you like my portfolio, you can star it! (Thanks if you do it üòç)

If you want to modify my portfolio to make your own, you can find the commands below!

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
